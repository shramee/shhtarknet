## Under the hood

### Secret structure

A secret is represented by these attributes,

#### contract
Secrets are bound to a contract address, contracts can only consume secret matching the contract address.

#### id
The identifier for the secret, contracts use the ID to refer to the secret.

#### hash
The value of the secret is never saved but only its hash

### Creating a secret

* You create a secret with the UI.
* Secret hash is generated and secret is saved to the DB.
* 

### Consuming a secret

* Cairo contracts create a queue of jobs
* Endpoint `shhtarknet_jobs` returns an array of jobs
* Rust probes the contract at regular intervals to find jobs

### Job structure

A job represents a request to consume the secret, with a bunch of passwords to compare against.

**:warning: Notice:** multiple candidates make it harder to identify the value that matched. [Is their a better way?](is-their-a-better-way-)

A job is defined by,

#### candidate_len `felt`
Number of candidates to compare

#### candidate `felt*`
Pointer to the first candidate

#### callback_contract `felt`
Contract to invoke when request is processed

#### callback_entrypoint `felt`
Contract entrypoint to call when request is processed

#### callback_param `felt`
An optional custom parameter to identify what needs to
be done if the job succeeds.

üü¢ Invoke will not include matched value, so use this param to identify what needs to be done (or what/who for).

### Processing the job

Executing the job involves,

1. Looping all candidates and matching against the saved hash.
2. Invoke `callback_entrypoint` in `callback_entrypoint` with `callback_param` and,
   - `TRUE` If one of the values matched the secret or
   - `FALSE` If none of the values matched the secret
3. Job report is created and available via the API.
